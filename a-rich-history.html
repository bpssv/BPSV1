        <p>BPS is steeped in more than 40 years of rich history and tradition that began with the extraordinary vision of one man — Late Shri S. L. Batra. From teaching classes in the 1980s in a tiny shed to securing acres of land in East Delhi, Shri S.L.
            Batra was a true educationist. He long envisioned a progressive school that offered education as an experience to anyone eager to learn and willing to work hard. Inspired by a deep love of learning, the gifts of nature and the diversity of
            humanity, Late Shri S. L. Batra set out to bring a better educational experience at a time and place where it was needed most.</p>
        <p>
            Bharti Public School, Swasthya Vihar has been blossoming with a spirit and a vision to ignite the passion for learning among its students, for the past four decades. Ever since the inception of the school it has made rapid strides & phenomenal progress
            and has won itself a niche among the leading schools of East Delhi. The journey from aspiration to achievement has been a long one. The edifice ‘Unfolding the Infinite Potential’ stands true under the tutelage and direction of the current
            Principal, Dr. Savita Arora, a recipient of the National Teacher’s Award awarded by the Hon’ble President of India, Dr. Pranab Mukherjee.
        </p>
        <p>
            BPS is a proud recipient of the British Council’s International School Award for the second time in row and as a part of the same; the school pursues regular national and international exchange programmes with the U.K., USA and France for teachers and
            students, thereby developing global perspective and cementing lifelong relationships.</p>
        <p>
            The green school campus boasts of an excellent infrastructure with modern facilities like smart boards. The well stocked digital library provides the latest & up-to-date books for reading & reference material. It has fully equipped computer and science
            labs with updated internet facilities. The school auditorium & an amphitheatre provides a conducive environment for holding various events in the school. It is an excellent arena for budding sports persons with facilities for indoor and outdoor
            games. The school boasts of full-fledged cricket, skating, badminton & basketball academies being run by ex-international players. Many of our sports stars have participated and won accolades at the National School Games. [solar panel/hanging

            The integration of life skills in the curriculum and Social Outreach Initiatives has inculcated a system of values among the students. This has made them aware and sensitive towards the societal responsibility to the community and encouraged them to think
            beyond the narrow confines of ‘I’ and reach out to connect compassionately with all.</p>
        <p>
            The role of school in child development begins as early as pre-school and continues through childhood. We not only provide a structured education but also promote a child’s mental and psychological growth. Aside from learning academics, the students are
            provided experience to imbibe the life skills such as teamwork, good manners, unity, sharing, and responsibility in a safe environment.
