                    state. His passion for work was iconic. Even severe illness and long periods of hospitalisation could not bog him down. He would spring back each time with a more infectious zest for life and greater commitment to work. Never the one
                    to compromise with his core values of honesty and integrity, his quest for perfection was iconic. A Samaritan, his philanthropic ways had people flocking to him for advice and help and … no one ever returned empty handed.

                <p>Dr. Batra's leadership at the Bharti Public Group of Schools will be sorely missed. His lofty ideals will, forever, be a source of strength and inspiration for all of us and guide us in all our endeavors. His lofty ideals will, forever,
